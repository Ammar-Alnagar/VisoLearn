    "prompt": "Okay, let's create a prompt focusing on a simple, clear interaction suitable for a 3-year-old, incorporating the treatment plan goals within a realistic setting. Since the specific \"Topic Focus\" was left blank, I will choose a fundamental social skill: **Taking Turns**. This directly addresses social communication, can involve a specific interest (the toy used), and demonstrates independence in managing the interaction.\n\n**Here is your Exceptional Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n\"A realistic scene captures two young children, approximately 3 years old, engaged in taking turns with a simple toy, embodying early social communication development. The main focus is on Child A, wearing a **pastel mint green long-sleeved shirt** with visible **soft cotton texture**, sitting upright on the floor. Child A has just placed a **bright primary-red wooden ring** onto a **natural light-wood stacking tower** base positioned directly between the two children. Child A is now looking expectantly towards Child B with a **neutral, calm facial expression**, their hands resting gently in their lap, signifying the end of their turn. Child B, wearing a **warm bumblebee-yellow t-shirt**, sits opposite Child A, slightly leaning forward, eyes focused on the stacking tower, one hand reaching towards a **sky-blue wooden ring** resting on the floor nearby. They are sitting on a **light beige, tightly woven floor mat** with a **subtle crisscross pattern texture**. Behind them, a **plain, soft-grey wall** ensures focus remains on the children. To the far left, partially visible, is the corner of a **simple white toy bin**. The scene is illuminated by **soft, diffused mid-morning natural light** coming from a large unseen window to the right, creating gentle highlights on the children's hair and soft, realistic shadows on the floor mat beneath them. The camera angle is an **eye-level medium shot**, framing both children from the waist up, clearly showing the toy, their postures, and interaction space. The overall emotional tone is **calm, patient, and gently focused**, highlighting the moment of transition in turn-taking. The style is **Photorealistic**, capturing lifelike details akin to high-quality child development photography. The **smooth, polished surface** of the wooden rings and tower contrasts with the soft textures of their clothing and the woven mat. Ensure **high detail, high quality , 4k**. 8k resolution, professional realistic, masterful composition.\"",
