## 7. Core Components & Logic

### 7.1. Main Application (`app.py`)

This is the main entry point that initializes the Gradio user interface and ties all the backend modules together. It loads the configuration and launches the web server.

### 7.2. Configuration (`config.py`)

This module centralizes all application settings. It loads secrets from the `.env` file and defines static configurations like available image styles, difficulty levels, and default therapeutic plans.

### 7.3. AI Models (`models/`)

This directory contains the core logic for interacting with AI services and implementing the platform's learning features.

*   `image_generation.py`: Handles communication with the OpenAI API to generate images based on dynamically created prompts.
*   `story_generation.py` & `story_agents.py`: A multi-agent system that creates coherent narrative structures and ensures character consistency for the comic generator.
*   `evaluation.py`: Contains the custom evaluation engine. It uses Google Gemini to analyze user descriptions, going beyond simple keyword matching to understand semantic meaning and track identified concepts.
*   `prompt_generation.py`: Constructs detailed, context-aware prompts for the AI models, tailored to the user's age, support level, and therapeutic goals.

### 7.4. User Interface (`ui/`)

This package defines the Gradio interface.

*   `interface.py`: Defines the main Gradio `Blocks` layout, connecting UI components (buttons, sliders, text boxes) to the backend functions in the `models` and `utils` packages.

### 7.5. Utilities (`utils/`)

This directory contains helper modules for various tasks.

*   `comic_panel_splitter.py`: Implements the computer vision pipeline using OpenCV to detect panel boundaries in a generated comic image and split it into individual scenes.
*   `file_operations.py`: Manages data export functionality, including saving sessions as JSON/CSV and generating PDF reports. It also handles Google Drive integration.
*   `state_management.py`: Manages the application's session state, ensuring user progress and settings persist across interactions within a session.

---

## 8. Third-party Dependencies

The project relies on several key third-party libraries. The complete list is available in `requirements.txt`.

### 9.1. Running Tests

To run the entire test suite, use `pytest`:

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=models --cov=utils --cov-report=html
```

### 9.2. Test Structure

*   **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual functions, such as prompt generation or API request formatting. These are designed to be fast and isolated.
    *   Example: `tests/test_image_generation.py` would test the `generate_image_fn` with various configurations and mock the API call.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the complete workflow of a feature, such as a full image description-evaluation cycle or the entire comic generation pipeline.
    *   Example: `tests/test_integration.py` would call the image generation function, then pass the result to the evaluation function to ensure they work together correctly.
*   **Performance Tests:** Use `pytest-benchmark` to measure the execution time of critical functions like API calls and evaluation logic.

## 10. Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### 10.1. Common Problems

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`ModuleNotFoundError`** on startup | The virtual environment is likely not activated. Run `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows). If that fails, reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`. |
| **API key not found / Authentication Error** | Ensure your `.env` file exists in the root directory and contains the correct, valid API keys for `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. |
| **Image generation fails with `RateLimitError`** | You have exceeded the rate limits of your OpenAI API plan. Wait before trying again or consider upgrading your plan. |
| **Comic panel extraction fails or is inaccurate** | This may be due to an issue with the OpenCV installation or an unusually complex generated image. Verify that `opencv-python` is installed correctly. |
| **Slow response times** | API calls to generative models can take time. If performance is consistently poor, check your internet connection and monitor system resources (RAM, CPU). Caching is implemented to mitigate this for repeated requests. |
| **Google Drive authentication fails** | The `token.pickle` file may be expired or corrupted. Delete it from the root directory and re-run the application. You will be prompted to go through the authentication flow again. |

### 10.2. Diagnostic Tools

A health check script is available to diagnose common configuration and connectivity issues.

```bash
# [Info Needed: Assuming a 'health_check.py' script exists as described in the README]
python health_check.py
```
This script will verify the Python version, check for missing dependencies, and test API connectivity.
