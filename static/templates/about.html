                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    VisoLearn was created with a clear mission: to leverage AI
                    technology to create personalized, adaptive visual learning
                    experiences that support the unique needs of children with
                    autism spectrum disorder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that by combining advanced AI capabilities with
                    evidence-based educational approaches, we can help children
                    with autism develop essential communication, observation,
                    and language skills through engaging visual content.

                <h2>The Science Behind VisoLearn</h2>
                <p>
                    Our approach is built on research showing that many
                    individuals with autism have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visual learning strengths</strong> - Often
                        processing visual information more effectively than
                        verbal information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Detail-focused processing</strong> - Frequently
                        noticing and remembering specific details in visual
                        scenes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Systematic learning patterns</strong> -
                        Benefiting from structured, sequential learning
                        approaches
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Need for personalization</strong> - Responding
                        best to interventions tailored to their specific profile
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    VisoLearn leverages these strengths while addressing common
                    challenges in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expressive language</li>
                    <li>Detail integration into holistic understanding</li>
                    <li>Generalization of concepts</li>
                    <li>Sustained attention</li>
                </ul>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Image Generation</h3>
                        <p>
                            VisoLearn uses Stable Diffusion 3.5, a
                            state-of-the-art AI image generation model, to
                            create custom educational images tailored to each
                            child's specific needs, interests, and learning
                            objectives.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Vision-Language Understanding</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our platform integrates Google's Gemini AI models to
                            analyze images and understand children's
                            descriptions, providing helpful, encouraging
                            feedback that guides their learning.

                        <h3>Adaptive Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            The system automatically adjusts difficulty levels
                            based on performance, ensuring that each child is
                            appropriately challenged without becoming
                            frustrated.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
                        <p>
                            Comprehensive monitoring tools allow educators and
                            caregivers to track development over time and
                            identify areas where additional support may be
                            needed.
